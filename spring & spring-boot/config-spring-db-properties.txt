spring.jpa.show-sql
  oolean
  true/false
  Default - false
  Determines whether to log SQL queries in console or not. Logs the queries if set to true. 

spring.jpa.open-in-view
  boolean
  true/false
  Default - true
  Creates session for each request and keeps the session active till request is fulfilled/processed. If this option is enabled, any update in entity could be saved without even using @Transactional. This might cause some unexpected issues which are difficult to be traced. It's always better to keep it false and handle the transaction manually.

spring.data.jpa.repositories.bootstrap-mode
  string/enum
  default, lazy, deferred
  default -> Registers and initializes repositories eagerly
  lazy -> Registers repositories eagerly but does not initialize them. Initialization happens at first use(after application started)
  deferred -> ***???***

spring.datasource.hikari.auto-commit
  boolean
  true/false
  Default - true
  If enabled, without the need of @Transaction or manual commit, spring commits each and every transaction/update happens to an entity object. This makes developer life easy to not bother about commit but will be problematic if we have more than one dependent DB calls. It's always better to keep it false and handle the transaction manually.

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto
  string/enum
  create, create-drop, update, validate, none
  Default - If no schema manager provided -> create-drop ***???*** , else noneg
  create -> Hibernate drops existing tables and creates new tables
  create-drop -> Creates tables and drops them when processing is completed. Used in test cases
  update -> Updates existing tables but does not delete the existing tables or columns
  validate -> Just validates if all tables exist or not
  none -> Does nothing

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.generate_statistics
  boolean
  true/false
  Default - false
  Collects statistics for each entity manager and also adds loggers for each SQL execution. Could be time and resource consuming hence advised to turn it off in PROD.
