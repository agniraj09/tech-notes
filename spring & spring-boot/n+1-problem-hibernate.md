What is N+1 problem in Hibernate ?
---
> The N+1 problem is a common issue that can occur in Hibernate and other Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries. It's a type of performance problem that happens when an application needs to load multiple related entities, resulting in a large number of unnecessary queries to the database.
Here's a breakdown of the problem:\
The "1" stands for the initial query that the application performs to retrieve the parent entities. For instance, if you want to fetch all users from a database, you would perform one query: SELECT * FROM Users.\
The "N" stands for the subsequent queries that are performed to fetch the related entities for each parent entity. Continuing the example, if each user has multiple orders and you want to fetch them as well, Hibernate would perform one query for each user to fetch their orders: SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE user_id = ?. This results in N additional queries, where N is the number of users.\

> The N+1 problem can significantly slow down an application because it results in many more database queries than necessary. It's generally more efficient to fetch the same data in a single query or fewer queries.

> To mitigate the N+1 problem, you can use techniques like:\
**Eager Fetching:** Here, related entities are loaded from the database at the same time as the parent entity. Hibernate provides @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER) to enable eager fetching.\
**Join Fetching:** This allows Hibernate to use a SQL JOIN clause to retrieve the parent entities and their related entities in a single SQL statement.\
**Batch Fetching:** Here, Hibernate can be instructed to load several related entities in one go, reducing the number of queries.\
**Using a Fetch Graph or Load Graph:** These are more advanced techniques that give fine-grained control over what entities and attributes should be fetched/loaded.\
Remember, each of these strategies comes with its own trade-offs and should be used judiciously based on your application's specific needs and performance requirements.

How eager fetching works ?
---
> Eager fetching is a strategy used in Hibernate to address the N+1 problem. When you apply eager fetching to a relationship, Hibernate retrieves the related entities at the same time as the parent entity, using a single database query instead of multiple queries.
Here's a simple example of how it works. Suppose you have two related entities: User and Order, where a User can have multiple Orders.
Without eager fetching, if you retrieve a User, Hibernate doesn't automatically load the Orders for that User. Instead, it waits until you specifically request the Orders (like when you call user.getOrders()). At that point, it issues a separate query for each User to fetch their Orders, leading to the N+1 problem.
With eager fetching, when you retrieve a User, Hibernate also automatically fetches all the Orders for that User using a JOIN query. This reduces the total number of queries, which can significantly improve performance when dealing with many entities.
You can specify eager fetching in your mapping using the @OneToMany or @ManyToOne annotations with the fetch attribute set to FetchType.EAGER. For example:
Java@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
private Set<Order> orders;

In this case, whenever a User is loaded, all related Orders are also loaded.
However, eager fetching should be used judiciously. While it can help solve the N+1 problem, it can also lead to performance issues if not used properly. For example, if you're retrieving a list of User entities but don't need the Order information right away, eager fetching can result in a lot of unnecessary data being loaded, consuming more memory and slowing down the application. Therefore, it's important to choose the right fetching strategy based on your application's specific needs.

How Join Fetching works ?
---
> Join fetching is another strategy used in JPA (Java Persistence API) and Hibernate to mitigate the N+1 problem.
Join fetching uses a JOIN SQL statement to retrieve associated entities in a single database query, instead of separate queries. This can significantly improve the performance of your application when dealing with parent-child entities or any related entities.
Here's a simple example to illustrate how it works. Suppose you have two entities: User and Order, where a User can have multiple Orders.
With join fetching, when you retrieve a User, Hibernate also fetches all the Orders for that User in a single query, using a SQL JOIN clause.
You can specify join fetching in a JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) query using the JOIN FETCH clause. For example:
JavaSELECT u FROM User u JOIN FETCH u.orders

In this case, whenever a User is loaded, all related Orders are also loaded in the same query.
Join fetching can be a powerful tool to optimize database access in your application. However, like all fetching strategies, it should be used judiciously. Overusing join fetching can lead to loading too much unnecessary data and can also cause problems like multiple bag fetch exception.
For more complex fetching needs, you might want to consider using other strategies such as entity graphs or batch fetching.

What is the difference between Eager Fetching and Join Fetching in Hibernate ?
---
> Eager Fetching and Join Fetching are both strategies used in Hibernate to load associated entities. However, they work in slightly different ways and are suitable for different use cases.
Eager Fetching:
Eager fetching is a strategy that you can define at the entity mapping level. When you set a relationship to be eagerly fetched, Hibernate will automatically load the associated entities whenever the parent entity is fetched from the database.
Eager fetching is declared using FetchType.EAGER in the relationship annotation. For example, @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER).
Eager fetching can result in multiple round trips to the database if not handled properly, leading to the N+1 problem. This is because Hibernate may use separate queries to fetch the parent entity and its associated entities.
Eager fetching is typically best used when the associated entities are always needed with the parent entity.
Join Fetching:
Join fetching is a strategy that you specify at the query level. When you use join fetching, Hibernate uses a SQL JOIN clause to fetch the parent entity and its associated entities in a single query.
Join fetching is specified in a JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) query using the JOIN FETCH clause. For example, SELECT u FROM User u JOIN FETCH u.orders.
Join fetching can help mitigate the N+1 problem by reducing the number of database queries.
However, join fetching can also lead to loading too much data if you're not careful, because it fetches all associated entities for each returned parent entity. It's generally best used when you specifically need the parent entities and their associated entities for a particular operation, but not for all operations.
In general, the choice between eager fetching and join fetching (and other fetching strategies) depends on your specific use case and performance requirements. It's often beneficial to understand the data access patterns of your application and choose the fetching strategy that best suits those patterns.
