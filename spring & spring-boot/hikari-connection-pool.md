Hikari Connection Pool(HikariCP)
---
HikariCP is a high-performance Java connection pool. Connection pooling is a technique of creating and managing a pool of connections which are ready for use by any process that needs to connect to the database. This leads to more efficient use of system resources and a higher maximum load that the database can handle.

**Advantages of HikariCP in Spring Boot**
1. Performance: HikariCP is known for its superior performance and efficiency in comparison to other connection pools. It is designed to be lightweight and have a smaller footprint, with fewer locks and less contention.
2. Reliability: HikariCP emphasizes simplicity and reliability. It has a simpler design with less complexity, which can lead to fewer bugs and issues.
3. Spring Boot Integration: HikariCP is integrated well with Spring Boot and can be used out-of-the-box with Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. This makes it easy to use and configure.
4. Metrics Integration: HikariCP has built-in support for metrics, allowing developers to monitor and analyze their connection pool's behavior and performance.

**Disadvantages of HikariCP in Spring Boot**
1. Limited Configuration Options: Compared to other connection pools, HikariCP has fewer configuration options. While this does make it simpler to use, it may not be as flexible for certain use cases.
2. No JNDI Support: Unlike some other connection pools, HikariCP does not support JNDI. If your application requires JNDI, you will need to use a different connection pool or find a workaround.
3. Learning Curve: Although HikariCP is designed to be simple, it can still have a learning curve for developers who are new to it or to connection pooling in general.
4. Potential for Misconfiguration: Like any tool, HikariCP can be misconfigured, leading to poor performance or other issues. It's important to understand how HikariCP works and how to properly configure it.

Other Popular Connection Pools
---
1. **Apache Commons DBCP2:** This is a popular connection pool that is known for its flexibility and functionality. It provides a wide range of features and configuration options, but it's not as fast as HikariCP.
2. **Tomcat JDBC Connection Pool:** This is the default connection pool provided by Tomcat. It offers a good balance between performance and flexibility. It provides advanced features like statement caching and connection validation.
3. **C3P0:** This is another popular connection pool that's known for its robustness and stability. It provides a wide range of features and options but isn't as fast as some of the other options.
4. **BoneCP:** This is a fast and efficient open-source connection pool. It's known for its speed and simplicity but it's no longer being maintained.
5. **Vibur DBCP:** This is a concurrent, fast, and fully-featured JDBC connection pool. It provides many unique features not available in other connection pools.
6. **Proxool:** This is an open-source connection pool that's easy to configure and extend. However, it hasn't been updated for quite some time.

Some Important HikariCP Configurations
---
1. **spring.datasource.hikari.maximumPoolSize:** This property sets the maximum number of connections that can be allocated by the pool at a given time. It should be set based on the expected concurrent usage.
2. **spring.datasource.hikari.minimumIdle:** This property represents the minimum number of idle connections that HikariCP tries to maintain in the pool. If the idle connections dip below this value, HikariCP will add more connections to meet this setting.
3. **spring.datasource.hikari.connectionTimeout:** This property sets the maximum number of milliseconds that a client (that's your application) will wait for a connection from the pool. If this time is exceeded without a connection becoming available, a SQLException will be thrown.
4. **spring.datasource.hikari.idleTimeout:** This property controls the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool. Idle connections will not be retired once the pool reaches its minimumIdle configuration.
5. **spring.datasource.hikari.poolName:** This property allows you to set a name for your connection pool. It can be useful for monitoring and debugging purposes.
6. **spring.datasource.hikari.maxLifetime:** This property sets the maximum lifetime (in milliseconds) of a connection in the pool. Once a connection has lived for this duration, it will be retired from the pool.
7. **spring.datasource.hikari.autoCommit:** This property controls the default auto-commit behavior of connections returned from the pool.
8. **spring.datasource.hikari.connectionTestQuery:** If your driver supports JDBC4, you can skip this setting. But for older drivers, this property sets the SQL query that will be executed to test the validity of connections.
